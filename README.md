# Hyper Effects

[![Pub Version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/hyper_effects?label=Pub)](https://pub.dev/packages/hyper_effects)

[Hyper Effects](https://github.com/hyper-designed/hyper_effects) is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) package
inspired from SwiftUI's syntax to create beautiful effects in Flutter. With just a few lines of code after your
widget, you can add any number of effects and transitions with ease.

Demo: [hyper-effects-demo.web.app](https://hyper-effects-demo.web.app/)

## Features

* 📏 **Compact Syntax:** Write a single line of code for a whole suite of complex effects.
* 🔁 **Animate Everything:** No animation controllers or tweening needed. Animate any widget with a line of code.
* 🔁 **Scroll Transitions:** Control how your widgets look based on their position in a scroll view.
* 🔁 **Pointer transitions:** No gesture detectors or state management required. Control how your widgets look based on
pointer events.
* 🚀 **Easy Integration:** Missing an effect? The API is designed to be simple and easy to extend.

## Getting started

### Installation

Add this package to your dependencies in your pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  hyper_effects: <latest_version>
```

or run following command in your project directory:

```
flutter pub add hyper_effects
```

### Usage

For any widget you have, you can append any number of effects and transitions to it using the extensions like so:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
  ).opacity(myCondition ? 0 : 1);
}
```

However, this will not animate the effect. This will only wrap the widget with the specific effect and use the value
provided.

### List of Effects

### Animations

To animate the effects, you need to call the `animate` method on the widget like so:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
  )
      .opacity(myCondition ? 0 : 1)
      .animate(trigger: myCondition);
}
```

`trigger` is a parameter of type `Object`. It's inspired from SwiftUI's `value` parameter on its `animation` modifier.
Whenever the value of `trigger` changes, the effect will animate to the new value. In this case, `myCondition` is the
trigger value. You can use any object as a trigger value, but you will likely want to use the same object that you use
to
control the condition of the effect as it is the point in which the effect should animate.

HyperEffects takes heavy inspiration from SwiftUI in that it attempts to provide Apple-like default values for
everything, that means that by default, animations are of 350ms duration and use Apple's custom easeInOut curve. The
result is a very smooth and natural feeling animation that is very reminiscent of Apple's style.

Despite having really nice default values, the API of course allows you to customize the animation to your liking. You
can do so by your own duration and curve.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
  )
      .opacity(myCondition ? 0 : 1)
      .animate(
        trigger: myCondition,
        duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 200),
        curve: Curves.easeOutQuart,
      );
}
```

You can combine and chain any number of effects like so:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
  )
      .opacity(myCondition ? 0 : 1)
      .blur(myCondition ? 10 : 0)
      .scale(myCondition ? 0.5 : 1)
      .translateX(myCondition ? 100 : 0)
      .animate(trigger: myCondition);
}
```

Since these are convenient extensions, you can use the effects as Widgets using the `apply` method like so:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return OpacityEffect(
    opacity: myCondition ? 0 : 1,
  ).apply(
    context,
    BlurEffect(
      blur: myCondition ? 10 : 0,
    ).apply(
      context,
      ScaleEffect(
        scale: myCondition ? 0.5 : 1,
      ).apply(
        context,
        TranslateEffect(
          offset: Offset(myCondition ? 100 : 0, 0),
        ).apply(
          context,
          Container(
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

#### Properties

* trigger: The value used to trigger the animation. As long as the value of trigger is the same, the animation will not
  be triggered again.
* duration: The duration of the animation.
* curve: The curve of the animation.
* onEnd: A callback that is called when the animation ends.
* repeat: Determines how many times the animation should be repeated.
* reverse: A boolean property that determines whether the animation should be reversed after each repetition.
* delay: A delay before the animation starts.
* playIf: A callback that returns whether the animation should be played or skipped. If the callback returns false, the
  animation will be skipped, even when it is explicitly triggered.

### One Shot Animations

If you want to trigger an animation immediately, you can use the `oneShot` function which triggers a chain of effects
immediately without a trigger parameter.
This function is useful when you want to start an animation as soon as the widget is built, without waiting for a
specific trigger to change.

Here's an example of how to use the `oneShot` function:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
  ).slideInFromBottom()
      .oneShot(
    // All the normal parameters inside of .animate() but without the trigger parameter.
  );
}
```

### Animate After Animations

The `animateAfter` function triggers the animation after the last animation in the chain ends.
It's useful when you want to create a sequence of animations where one animation starts after the previous one ends.

Here's an example of how to use the `animateAfter` function:

```dart
  @override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Center(
    child: GestureDetector(
      onTap: () {
        setState(() {
          trigger = !trigger;
        });
      },
      child: Image.asset('assets/pin_ball_256x.png', width: 150, height: 150)
          .shake()
          .oneShot(
        delay: const Duration(seconds: 1),
        repeat: -1,
        playIf: () => !trigger,
      )
          .translateY(300, from: 0)
          .animate(
        trigger: trigger,
        curve: Curves.easeOutQuart,
        duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 2000),
        playIf: () => trigger,
      )
          .slideOut(const Offset(0, -300))
          .animateAfter(
        curve: Curves.elasticOut,
        duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 450),
        onEnd: () => setState(() => trigger = false),
      )
          .resetAll(),
    ),
  );
}
```

See this example in action in the demo app: [hyper-effects-demo.web.app](https://hyper-effects-demo.web.app/)

### Reset Animations

Using `resetAll` at the end of the chain of animations will reset all the effects in the chain to their original values.

When the animation is triggered again, all the effects will animate from their original values to the new values.

### Delayed Animations

The `delay` parameter is used in the `animate`, `animateAfter` and `oneShot` methods. This parameter allows you to
specify a delay
before the animation starts.
The `delay` is specified as a `Duration`. Here's an example of how to use the `delay` parameter:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
  )
   .opacity(myCondition ? 0 : 1)
   .animate(
    trigger: myCondition,
    delay: const Duration(seconds: 1), // 1 second delay before the animation starts after the trigger changes.
  );
}
```

In this example, the opacity animation will start 1 second after the `myCondition` trigger changes.

### Repeat Animations

The `repeat` parameter is used in the `animate`, `animateAfter`, and `oneShot` functions.
This parameter allows you to specify how many times the animation will be repeated.
The repeat parameter is an `integer`, where 0 (default) means the animation will only play once and not repeat.
Any positive integer specifies the number of times the animation will repeat.
If the `repeat` parameter is set to -1, the animation will repeat indefinitely.

Here's an example of how to use the `repeat` parameter:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
  )
   .opacity(myCondition ? 0 : 1)
   .animate(
    trigger: myCondition,
    repeat: 3, // The animation will repeat 3 times
  );
}
```

Note that if the `reverse` parameter is set to true, the repetition counter will count for each animation direction.
For example, if the `repeat` parameter is set to 3 and the `reverse` parameter is set to true, the animation will
play only 3 times, one of which is the reverse animation.

`forwards -> backwards -> forwards -> done.`

### Rolling Text

The Rolling Text feature in Hyper Effects allows you to create a rolling animation from one text to another. Each
character rolls individually to form the new text. This feature provides a visually appealing way to transition between
different text states in your application.

#### Usage

To use the Rolling Text feature, you can use the roll extension on any Text widget. Here's an example:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Text('Hello').roll('World');
}
```

In this example, the text will roll from 'Hello' to 'World'. Each character in 'Hello' will roll until it changes to the
corresponding character in 'World'.

#### Customization

The Rolling Text feature provides several options for customization:

- padding: This option allows you to set the internal padding between the row of symbol tapes and the clipping mask.
- tapeStrategy: This option determines the string of characters to create and roll through for each character index
  between the old and new text.
- tapeCurve: This option determines the curve each roll of symbol tape uses to slide up and down through its characters.
- tapeSlideDirection: This option determines the direction each roll of symbol tape slides through its characters.
- staggerTapes: This option determines whether the tapes should be staggered or not.
- staggerSoftness: This option determines how harsh the stagger effect is.
- reverseStaggerDirection: This option determines whether the stagger effect should be reversed or not.

Here's an example of how to use these options:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Text('Hello').roll(
    'World',
    padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 8, vertical: 4),
    tapeStrategy: TapeStrategy.random,
    tapeCurve: Curves.easeInOutQuart,
    tapeSlideDirection: TapeSlideDirection.down,
    staggerTapes: true,
    staggerSoftness: 0.5,
    reverseStaggerDirection: true,
  );
}
```

To trigger the rolling text effect, you need to call the `animate` or `oneShot` functions as normal:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Text('Hello').roll('World').animate(trigger: myTrigger);
}
```

When myTrigger changes, the text will roll from 'Hello' to 'World' or vice versa.
The animate method also accepts duration and curve parameters that allow you to customize the animation's duration
and easing curve.

Please note that if you specify a curve that goes outside the bounds of 0 and 1 like Curves.elasticIn/Out or
Curves.easeIn/OutBack, the UI will crash with a warning that the width cannot be negative. To resolve this,
simply specify a custom curve for the width. You can do so like this:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Text('Hello').roll('World').animate(
    trigger: myTrigger,
    curve: Curves.easeInOutQuart,
    duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500),
    widthCurve: Curves.easeInOutQuart,
  );
}
```

### Transitions

Transitions are a special type of effect that allows you to control how your widgets look based on some continuous
value. For example, you can control the opacity of a widget based on its position in a scroll view or based on the
pointer position.

Transitions use a builder pattern to provide you with an `event` property that gives you active information about the
state of a transition for your widget. You can use this information to control how your widget looks, and it will
animate automatically based on the effects you use inside.

#### Scroll Transitions

Scroll transitions are transitions that are based on the position of a widget in a scroll view. You can use the
`scrollTransition` extension on any widget to add a scroll transition to it.

```dart
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView.builder(
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        return Container(
          width: 350,
          height: 100,
          margin: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16, vertical: 8),
          alignment: Alignment.center,
          decoration: BoxDecoration(
            color: randomColor(index),
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(16),
          ),
          child: Text(
            'Item $index',
            style: const TextStyle(
              fontSize: 24,
              color: Colors.white,
            ),
          ),
        ).scrollTransition(
          (context, widget, event) => widget
              .blur(
                switch (event.phase) {
                  ScrollPhase.identity => 0,
                  ScrollPhase.topLeading => 10,
                  ScrollPhase.bottomTrailing => 10,
                },
              )
              .scale(
                switch (event.phase) {
                  ScrollPhase.identity => 1,
                  ScrollPhase.topLeading => 0.9,
                  ScrollPhase.bottomTrailing => 0.9,
                },
              ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
```

In a scroll transition, the `phase` is a `ScrollPhase` enum that determines the view-state of a widget in a scroll view.
- `ScrollPhase.identity` is when the widget is fully viewable in the scroll view.
- `ScrollPhase.topLeading` is when the widget is partially viewable from the top/left, IE: It's leaving the top or left 
of the scroll view.
- `ScrollPhase.bottomTrailing` is when the widget is partially viewable from the bottom/right, IE: It's leaving the 
bottom or right of the scroll view.

In addition to the ScrollPhase, the `event` also provides `screenOffsetFraction` which is a double value between -1, 0
and 1 that represents the progress the scroll view is moving away from the center of the scroll view.
- If the widget is near the center of the scroll view, the value tends towards 0.
- As the widget moves towards the ceiling of the scroll view, the value tends towards 1. It clamps to 1 when the item is
fully out of the scroll view.
- As the item moves towards the floor of the scroll view, the value tends towards -1. It clamps to -1 when the item is
fully out of the scroll view.

#### Caution
Be careful when using `screenOffsetFraction` as it can be a bit tricky to use. The way transitions work
internally is that they lerp to and from a specific internal value. That value for scroll transitions is the 
ScrollPhase.

With that in mind, despite the fact that you can use `phase` to animte your widgets easily with the extensions, for 
other properties like`screenOffsetFraction`, you will need to use the manual Effects API to animate them.

```dart
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView.builder(
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        return Container(
          width: 350,
          height: 100,
          margin: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16, vertical: 8),
          alignment: Alignment.center,
          decoration: BoxDecoration(
            color: randomColor(index),
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(16),
          ),
          child: Text(
            'Item $index',
            style: const TextStyle(
              fontSize: 24,
              color: Colors.white,
            ),
          ),
        ).scrollTransition((context, widget, event) => TransformEffect(
              rotateX: -90 * event.screenOffsetFraction * pi / 180,
              translateY: (event.screenOffsetFraction * -1) * 200,
              translateZ: event.screenOffsetFraction.abs() * 100,
              scaleX: 1 - (event.screenOffsetFraction.abs() / 2),
              depth: 0.002,
            ).apply(context, widget));
      },
    );
  }
```

When using the manual Effects API directly, you can use any parameter and manipulate their values as much as you like in the above example, whereas with the convenient extensions API, you may be limited to using the internally
animated value. In scroll transitions, the internally animated value is the `phase` property.

#### Pointer Transitions

Pointer transitions are transitions that provide events based on the pointer's position either locally or globally
depending on configuration. This transition has many configurable parameters that allow you to control how the 
transition should output its values in its builder.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Container(
    decoration: const BoxDecoration(
      color: Colors.blue,
    ),
  ).pointerTransition(
        (context, child, event) => child.translateXY(
      event.valueOffset.dx / 2,
      event.valueOffset.dy / 2,
      fractional: true,
    ),
  );
}
```

In the above example, the container will move half the distance of the pointer's movement in the x and y axis. The
`fractional` parameter is set to true, which means that the widget will move by multiplying its size by the value
provided. If `fractional` is set to false, the widget will move by the value provided directly in pixels.

`value` is a `double` parameter that represents the distance of the pointer device from the `origin`.
A value of zero is when the pointer device is at the `origin`.
A value of 1 or -1 is when the pointer device is at the farthest point from the `origin`.
This value is the average of the `valueOffset`'s x and y values.

`valueOffset` is an `Offset` parameter very similar to `value` but provides more information about the individual x and
y axes. It's The distance of the pointer device from the `origin` as an offset. 
A value offset of (0, 0) is when the pointer device is at the `origin`.
A value offset of (1, 1) is when the pointer device is at the farthest point from the `origin`.

`isInsideBounds` is a `boolean` parameter that decides whether the pointer is inside the bounds of the widget or not.

`position` is the raw position of the pointer. It's the position of the pointer device from the top left corner of the
target. The target depends on the configurations below.

##### Pointer Transition Properties

When using the pointer transition, you can provide multiple parameters to control its behavior, which is reflected back
in the `event` provided to the builder.

```dart
  Widget pointerTransition(
    PointerTransitionBuilder builder, {
    Alignment origin = Alignment.center,
    bool useGlobalPointer = false,
    bool transitionBetweenBounds = true,
    bool resetOnExitBounds = true,
    Curve curve = appleEaseInOut,
    Duration duration = const Duration(milliseconds: 125),
  }) {
    return PointerTransition(
      builder: builder,
      origin: origin,
      useGlobalPointer: useGlobalPointer,
      transitionBetweenBounds: transitionBetweenBounds,
      resetOnExitBounds: resetOnExitBounds,
      curve: curve,
      duration: duration,
      child: this,
    );
  }
```

`origin` is an `Alignment` parameter that determines the origin to transform the pointer position around.
- If the origin is set to `Alignment.center`, as the pointer moves away from the center of the screen, 
the `value` will increase.
- If the origin is set to `Alignment.topLeft`, as the pointer moves away from the top left corner of the screen, 
the `value` will increase.

`useGlobalPointer` is a `boolean` parameter that determines whether the pointer position should be calculated globally
or locally. If set to true, the pointer position will be calculated from the top left corner of the screen. If set to
false, the pointer position will be calculated from the top left corner of the widget.

`transitionBetweenBounds` is a `boolean` parameter that determines whether the transition should animate between the
bounds of the widget or not. If set to true, the transition will trigger the internal animation to reset when the
pointer moves in and out of the bounds of the widget. If set to false, the transition will snap instantly to 
the new values when the pointer moves in and out of the bounds of the widget.

`resetOnExitBounds` is a `boolean` parameter that determines whether this transition should reset the position of the
child back to a `value` of zero when the pointer device is outside the bounds of the widget. `transitionBetweenBounds`
decides whether the transition should animate or not.

`curve` is a `Curve` parameter that determines the curve of the internal when transitioning between bounds animation.

`duration` is a `Duration` parameter that determines the duration of the internal when transitioning between bounds.

#### Caution

Like the scroll transition, be careful when using `value` and `valueOffset` as it can be a bit tricky to use. The
pointer transition internally uses the `value` property to internally lerp between values. This means that if you use
other properties and expect them to transition perfectly, you may get unexpected results sometimes.
